# MUhyprland

MU (for Material Unity) is my (originaly plagiarized, but heavily modified) hyprland dotfiles. It tries to mimic google's material design 3 principles, while still sort of looking like your stock android UI. It uses matugen for generating colour palettes

REQUIREMENTS:
- most likely any of the fonts supporting the NERD icons for displaying, well, icons.
- Product Sans font installed, unless you want something else
- (if you want you can download the hypr_dynamic_cursors, since i have a small config made: https://github.com/VirtCode/hypr-dynamic-cursors)
- Hyprlock
- NWG displays, or just edit the config
- rofi-wayland
- dunst
- Waypaper (for switching wallpapers and automatically changing the colour scheme)
- Matugen (for generating said colour scheme)
- kitty

SHORTCUTS:
- Super + Enter = terminal
- Super + B = browser
- Super + E = File manager
- Super + SHIFT + D = pwvucontrol
- Super + V = clipse
- Super + M = g4music ( or just change it to your music player)
- Super + W = toggle waybar
- Super + ALT + P = restart pipewire (for when it shits the bed)
- Super + R = rofi emoji
- Super + Space = rofi apps
+ a lot more, but these are the main ones

ALSO, I DONT GUARANTEE IT WORKING ON YOUR SYSTEM, I AM NOT A TECH WIZARD AND I WILL NOT FIX IT. (i.e. if you want something figure it out yourself dumbnuts)






























ok that's enough, I love you *mwah* 💋
